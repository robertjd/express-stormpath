* The `organizationNameKey` field is being shown on the login form, even when a valid subdomain is avaiable.  If the subdomain is a valid domain, the name key field should not be shown to the user, but we should make the authentication attempt against the resolved organization.  If the subdomain is not a valid org, then we should show the field becuse the user must provide us with a name key.

* In any authentication situation where the user needs to supply the name key (because we couldn't resolve an organization by subdomain), we shouldn't try to fetch the organization first.  It's simpler to just make the authentication attempt against the application, and specify the `organizationNameKey` in the request.  If the the organization doesn't exist (or isnt mapped to the application) you will get error `2014`, `The referenced Account Store does not exist.  It could have been deleted before the request was submitted.`  In this case, we must respond to the end-user with "Invalid Username, Password, or Organization".

* Only when the developer specifically disables an `organizationNameKey` form field should we post against the application and not specify a name key.
